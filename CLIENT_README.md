## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issues We Need to Fix First

### 1. **Service Pages Not Working (404 Errors)**
**What's wrong:** When people click on service types (General, Family, Anxiety counseling), they get error pages.  
**Why it matters:** Users think the website is broken and leave.  
**What we need from you:**
- Detailed information about each service type
- What to expect from each service
- Pricing for each service & outcomes
- What clients can expect in first session
- Typical session length and number
- How the progress is reviewed

### 2. **Email Problems**
**What's wrong:** Newsletter emails say "unsubscribe" but there's no link. To be fixed

### 3. **Payment Not Set Up**
**What's wrong:** Bank details and M-Pesa aren't active yet.  
**Why it matters:** You're missing donations and session payments!  
**What we need from you:**
- Bank account details to display
- M-Pesa Paybill number
- Instructions on how clients should pay
- Any preferred payment methods

### 4. **Social Media Links Inconsistent**
**What's wrong:** Facebook, Instagram show different website links; LinkedIn says Nairobi instead of Kakamega.  
**Why it matters:** Confuses visitors and harms SEO.  
**What you need to do:**
- Provide social media handles

## üéØ Important Improvements

### 5. **Add More Details to Services**
**User feedback:** "Add more detail on each service (what to expect, costs, outcomes)"  
**What we need from you:**
- For each service (General, Family, Anxiety, Depression, Couples):
  - What happens in the first session
  - How many sessions typical clients need
  - How you review progress
  - Expected outcomes
  - Any prerequisites or eligibility

**Template to fill out:**
```
Service Name: [e.g., General Counseling]
First Session: [describe what happens]
Duration: [e.g., 50 minutes]
Sessions: [typical range, e.g., 6-12]
Cost: [KES amount or sliding scale info]
Expected Outcomes: [what clients can expect to achieve]
```

### 6. **Create FAQs**
**User feedback:** "A simple FAQ would build more trust"  
**What we need from you:**
- Common questions clients ask about each service
- Common concerns about confidentiality
- Questions about online vs in-person sessions
- Questions about duration and cost
- Questions about subsidized sessions

**We'll organize these into sections by service type.**

### 7. **Terms & Conditions Page**
**User feedback:** "You also need a Terms of Use or Terms and Conditions section for your own legal protection"  
**What we need from you:**
- Your policies on:
  - Emergency mental health care (what you provide vs what you don't)
  - Educational vs clinical information
  - Session recording policy (do you record? How is it stored?)
  - When confidentiality can be broken (danger to self/others, legal requirements)
  - Cancellation policy (how late can someone cancel? What's the fee?)
  - Refund policy
  - Billing terms (when is payment due? Late fees?)
  - Intellectual property protection (for your blog content, resources)

**We can draft this based on common counseling practice standards, but you need to review and customize it to your actual policies.**

### 8. **Visual Content**
**User feedback:** "Consider adding more visuals that reflect Kenyan clientele and settings (for relatability)"  
**What you need to provide:**
- 10-15 high-quality images showing:
  - Kenyan people (with proper consent)
  - Local settings (Kakamega area)
  - Diverse representation
  - Professional counseling environments
  
**Where to get images:**
- Hire a photographer
- Use stock photos specifically with Kenyan/African representation
- Take photos of your actual office (with client consent where needed)

### 9. **Subsidized Therapy Process**
**User feedback:** "Create a clear process page for Apply for Subsidy"  
**What we need from you:**
- Eligibility criteria (income level, referral requirements, etc.)
- Number of subsidized spots available
- Application deadlines
- Required documentation
- How applicants are selected
- What percentage of cost is subsidized
